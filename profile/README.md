# Obsidian Covenant

**Where forgotten code is reforged in obsidian and returned to the Cyber community.**

Many classic cybersecurity tools have been lost to time - unmaintained, uncompiled, or abandoned.
Obsidian Covenant restores these projects with clean builds, updated code, fixed bugs, and active maintenance, while respecting the original authors and licenses.

## Our Mission
* Revive important pentesting and security tools from previous generations
* Provide stable, modernized source code
* Keep documentation intact while updating the implementation
* Preserve history while enabling today’s professionals and learners
* Maintain open, community-supported repositories

## Our Promise

Every restored project remains:
* Faithful to its original purpose
* Legally compliant with all licenses
* Clearly versioned and changelogged
* Open to community contribution

## Join the Covenant

Obsidian Covenant is a community pact to preserve the foundations of offensive security. We welcome packagers, tinkerers, maintainers, and reverse-engineers willing to help bring forgotten and legacy tools back to life.
